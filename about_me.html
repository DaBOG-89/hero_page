    <h1>About Me.</h1>
        <h2>Bio.</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Adesola Babaniji, a front-end developer based in Lagos. I specialize in creating responsive
            (perfect fit for laptops and smartphones), cost-effective, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and 
            JavaScript. I’m passionate about building web experiences that are accessible, intuitive, and visually engaging.
        </p>

        <h2>My Journey.</h2>
        <p>
            I discovered web development a few years ago and immediately fell in love with how code can bring ideas 
            to life. Since then, I’ve dedicated myself to learning the fundamentals of front-end development and exploring 
            back-end technologies like Node.js and PHP. Every project I work on teaches me something new and helps me 
            grow as a developer.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Skills & Expertise.</h2>
